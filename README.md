![OpenEDR](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenEDR-86C90E?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white&labelColor=86C90E)

A simulated **SOC-as-a-Service environment** demonstrating **real-world security monitoring & incident response**.

- 🖥️ Designed a fictional client infrastructure (Windows endpoints + AD + VPN + SIEM).  
- 📊 Built **custom detection rules** aligned with **MITRE ATT&CK**.  
- 🤖 Automated playbooks for phishing, malware triage, and IP reputation lookups.  
- 📂 Deliverables: topology diagrams, customer profile, SOC workflow docs, and incident reports.

## 2. Secure Hotel Network (Packet Tracer)

🔧 **Tools:**  
![Cisco Packet Tracer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cisco-PacketTracer-1BA0D7?style=for-the-badge&logo=cisco&logoColor=white&labelColor=1BA0D7) 

A secure **hotel network architecture**, simulated in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

- 🔐 Segmented departments across VLANs (Reception, HR, Sales, Admin, Store).  
- 🌐 Deployed a **DMZ** with Web, DHCP, and DNS servers.  
- 🔥 Configured **Cisco ASA firewalls** for layered security.  
- 🔒 Implemented **VPN tunnels** for secure inter-floor communications.  
- 📡 Centralized logging for monitoring and auditing.

## 3. Blockchain-Enabled Medical Report Management

🔧 **Tools:**  
![Blockchain](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blockchain-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=blockchaindotcom&logoColor=white&labelColor=000000) 
![SmartContracts](https://img.shields.io/badge/SmartContracts-F1C40F?style=for-the-badge&logo=ethereum&logoColor=000000&labelColor=F1C40F)

A **capstone research and development project** that leverages blockchain to solve long-standing challenges in Electronic Health Records (EHRs): fragmented data silos, breaches, and lack of interoperability.

- 🏥 **Decentralized Architecture:** Combined **Ethereum smart contracts** with **IPFS encrypted storage** for tamper-proof medical reports.  
- 🔑 **Patient Agency:** Patients remain true data owners, granting/revoking access to hospitals, pharmacies, and labs through blockchain-based consent.  
- 📡 **Interoperability:** HL7/FHIR-compliant schemas and APIs ensure seamless integration across hospital, pharmacy, and lab systems.  
- 🔒 **End-to-End Security:** Audit logs, consent management, and immutable records guarantee HIPAA/GDPR compliance.  
- 🖥️ **Technology Stack:** ReactJS dashboards, Web3.js/Ethers.js for blockchain communication, Firebase/MongoDB for authentication, and IPFS for distributed storage.  

This system transforms isolated health records into a **collaborative, patient-centered care network**, where all stakeholders securely share and access data in real time.
